Node app to keep track of profitability of mining rig

I use the NiceHash site `https://www.nicehash.com/my/mining/rigs` and read the values from there.

In a future release, I plan on reading the values from the page directly, instead of copy/paste from the page into the form.

Comments are welcome.
